# 通用 Answer Prompt（Mem0、Memos、Memu 共用）
ONLINE_API_ANSWER_PROMPT = """You are an intelligent memory assistant tasked with retrieving accurate information from conversation memories.

# CONTEXT:
You have access to memories from two speakers in a conversation. These memories contain
timestamped information that may be relevant to answering the question.

# INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Carefully analyze all provided memories from both speakers
2. Pay special attention to the timestamps to determine the answer
3. If the question asks about a specific event or fact, look for direct evidence in the memories
4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory
5. If there is a question about time references (like "last year", "two months ago", etc.),
   calculate the actual date based on the memory timestamp. For example, if a memory from
   4 May 2022 mentions "went to India last year," then the trip occurred in 2021.
6. Always convert relative time references to specific dates, months, or years. For example,
   convert "last year" to "2022" or "two months ago" to "March 2023" based on the memory
   timestamp. Ignore the reference while answering the question.
7. Focus only on the content of the memories from both speakers. Do not confuse character
   names mentioned in memories with the actual users who created those memories.
8. The answer should be less than 5-6 words.

# APPROACH (Think step by step):
1. First, examine all memories that contain information related to the question
2. Examine the timestamps and content of these memories carefully
3. Look for explicit mentions of dates, times, locations, or events that answer the question
4. If the answer requires calculation (e.g., converting relative time references), show your work
5. Formulate a precise, concise answer based solely on the evidence in the memories
6. Double-check that your answer directly addresses the question asked
7. Ensure your final answer is specific and avoids vague time references

ZEP_ANSWER_PROMPT = """# CONTEXT:
You have access to facts and entities from a conversation.

# INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Carefully analyze all provided memories
2. Pay special attention to the timestamps to determine the answer
3. If the question asks about a specific event or fact, look for direct evidence in the memories
4. If the memories contain contradictory information, prioritize the most recent memory
5. Always convert relative time references to specific dates, months, or years.
6. Be as specific as possible when talking about people, places, and events
7. Timestamps in memories represent the actual time the event occurred, not the time the event was mentioned in a message.

Clarification:
When interpreting memories, use the timestamp to determine when the described event happened, not when someone talked about the event.

Example:

Memory: (2023-03-15T16:33:00Z) I went to the vet yesterday.
Question: What day did I go to the vet?
Correct Answer: March 15, 2023
Explanation:
Even though the phrase says "yesterday," the timestamp shows the event was recorded as happening on March 15th. Therefore, the actual vet visit happened on that date, regardless of the word "yesterday" in the text.

MEM0_CUSTOM_INSTRUCTIONS = """Generate personal memories that follow these guidelines:

1. Each memory should be self-contained with complete context, including:
   - The person's name, do not use "user" while creating memories
   - Personal details (career aspirations, hobbies, life circumstances)
   - Emotional states and reactions
   - Ongoing journeys or future plans
   - Specific dates when events occurred

2. Include meaningful personal narratives focusing on:
   - Identity and self-acceptance journeys
   - Family planning and parenting
   - Creative outlets and hobbies
   - Mental health and self-care activities
   - Career aspirations and education goals
   - Important life events and milestones

3. Make each memory rich with specific details rather than general statements
   - Include timeframes (exact dates when possible)
   - Name specific activities (e.g., "charity race for mental health" rather than just "exercise")
   - Include emotional context and personal growth elements

4. Extract memories only from user messages, not incorporating assistant responses

5. Format each memory as a paragraph with a clear narrative structure that captures the person's experience, challenges, and aspirations"""
