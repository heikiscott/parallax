He also experiences emotional difficulty following a serious health warning on October 2, 2023, and a gastritis scare in early October.\n\nTo address these challenges, Sam adopts a comprehensive approach: he reduces soda and candy intake by substituting flavored seltzer water and healthier snacks, embraces cooking healthier meals learned in a cooking class (e.g., grilled salmon and vegetable stir-fry), and creates meal plans. He begins weightlifting on October 8, 2023, with Evan’s guidance, focusing on proper form and gradual progression, and plans hiking and low-impact exercises such as swimming, yoga, walking, and beach walks to accommodate his physical condition.\n\nFor stress relief, Sam engages in creative outlets like painting (encouraged by Evan), writing, and cooking, and finds relaxation in nature and car rides.
